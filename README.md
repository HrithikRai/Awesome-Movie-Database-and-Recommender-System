# Awesome-Movie-Database-and-Recommender-System

## Live Demo - https://hrs-amdb.herokuapp.com/

The folder AMDB contains all the files required to run the application but you will need to install some python dependencies:
Just run the below code to install these dependencies:

pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit-aggrid
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install requests

Also please change the address of the terminal to this folder and run the command:

streamlit run main_page.py


------------- OR -------------

### The project is live at - https://hrs-amdb.herokuapp.com/ 
(But the users section is a bit slow since 
i've used most of my resource limit in heroku free trial account.)

---------------------------

## Offline implentation is almost 10x faster than live version. 
### Please run the preprocessing.ipynb to generate necessary pickle files or just contact me, ill share the link

Please contact me incase of any trouble.
